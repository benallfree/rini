# n37c0d3

n37c0d3 (netcode) is a Typescript-friendly, highly optimized binary data packing/unpacking and messaging protocol designed for bare-meta TCP communication such as between native apps and servers, or server-to-server.

This binary protocol is 8-10x more compact than a JSON representation of the data.

The protocol supports packet versioning, fault-tolerant message boundary alignment, efficient memory management, and can serialize almost any pure data Javascript object.
